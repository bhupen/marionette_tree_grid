marionette_tree_grid
====================

This is a proof of concept for creating tree-grid behaviors using a modest amount of backbone / marionette code. It is a straightforward alternative to integrating with slickgrid, one that makes it comparatively easy to control the views for each cell of the grid. The data is lazy loaded in this prototype - the contents of each folder are fetched only when the folder is first opened. The organization of the tree is maintained by concatenating parent / child sort keys. The random data found in the prototype is courtesy of chance.js.
